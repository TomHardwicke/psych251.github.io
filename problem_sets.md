All problem sets will be due Sunday night by midnight.

Problem sets will be graded on a 1 - 5 rubric, with 5 being thorough and complete, 4 including one or two minor errors, 3 being incomplete or including at least one major error or quite a number of minor ones, 2 being seriously incomplete/incorrect, and 1 being barely attempted.

## Submitting Problem Sets

Please submit problem sets via sending an email to the [course instructors list](mailto://psych251-aut1718-staff@lists.stanford.edu). Aside from Problem Set 1, all submissions should include an HTML link to your rendered problem set. You can generate this sort of link using [RPubs](http://rpubs.com) by hitting "publish" in RStudio and following the directions. Or you can push your problem set to a github repository and use [rawgit](https://rawgit.com/) html preview to generate a link.

## Problem Set 1 - Git (due 10/1)

Follow the steps in the [git tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HSXY9LVoorPweLPBn5LkDUDSwA1ST_pGCkWxc47b_rw/edit#heading=h.y4i1ok9i1v35) and submit the final product.

## Problem Set 2 - Data wrangling (due 10/15)

This problem set will build `tidyverse` data-wrangling skills. The problem set is available in the [problem sets repository](https://github.com/psych251/problem_sets). Download it, fill in all the missing code (and narrative answers, where relevant). Then knit it and submit following the instructions above.

## Problem Set 3 - Computational Reproducibility (due 11/6)

This problem set will be a contribution to a meta-science project led by Tom Hardwicke, investigating computational reproducibility in the journal Psychological Science.

## Problem Set 4 - Visualization (due 11/27)

This problem set will aim to build visualization skills using `ggplot`.
