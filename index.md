## Course Goals

Students completing Psych 251 will:

* Be able to perform a psychology experiment on the web,
* Be able to analyze a study in terms of reliability (e.g. power, statistical choices), and validity (e.g. design, sampling),
* Master best practices for experimental data management, storage, and analysis, and
* Have a reproducible workflow for experimental data analysis and visualization, including comfort with a variety of `R` tools, especially those in the `tidyverse`.

## Pre-requisites

This course is a requirement for incoming graduate students in the Psychology department. It will be taught in the `R` statistical programming language and will be vastly easier if you have some prior experience with the language.

In addition, we will be relying heavily on version control using git and github. Please take a moment to set up a git account at https://github.com/, and to get it working on your computer before class starts.

## Readings

Please complete all readings before the class for which they are assigned. We will be using many of the techniques and workflows described in Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund's book, [R for Data Scientists](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), which is available free online. I highly recommend using it as a reference book.

<!-- Two other great books that we will refer to occasionally:

* Rosenthal, R., & Rosnow, R. L. (2008). Essentials of behavioral research: Methods and data analysis (3rd ed.). McGraw-Hill. -->

## Grading

* 40%: Problem sets (four, at 10% each);
* 50%: Final project components, including presentations, data collection, analysis, and writeup;
* 10%: Attendance and participation in class.
